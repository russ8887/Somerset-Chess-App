**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** 🟡 Partially Complete - Core system working, progress saving needs debugging

---

## 📊 Current Status Overview

### ✅ **COMPLETED & WORKING**
- **🚀 Live Deployment:** System is deployed on Render and accessible

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Database Models**
```python
# Key Models Added:
- CurriculumLevel: Foundation, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- CurriculumTopic: Individual chess lessons with content
- StudentProgress: Tracks student mastery of each topic
- TopicPrerequisite: Manages learning dependencies
- RecapSchedule: Implements spaced repetition system
```

### **Views & URLs**
```python
# New Views Added:
/training/<record_pk>/                    # Main training interface
/training/<record_pk>/mark-progress/      # Progress marking endpoint
```

### **Management Commands**
```bash
python manage.py populate_curriculum     # Sets up all 15 chess topics
python manage.py migrate                 # Creates database tables
```

### **Templates**
```
scheduler/templates/scheduler/
├── student_training.html                 # Main training interface
└── [existing templates...]
```

## 🔧 Technical Issue Details

### **Progress Saving Bug**
**Location:** `scheduler/views.py` - `mark_training_progress` function  
**Symptom:** Form submits successfully but page doesn't show next topic  
**Possible Causes:**
1. Progress record not being created/updated correctly
2. Topic advancement logic not finding next topic
3. Redirect not refreshing the training view properly
4. Student progress initialization missing

**Debug Steps Needed:**
```python
# Test in Django shell:
from scheduler.models import *
from scheduler.views import _calculate_student_level_and_elo

# Check if progress saving works
student = Student.objects.first()
topic = CurriculumTopic.objects.first()
# Test progress creation...
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### **Live Environment (Render)**
- ✅ **Code Deployed:** Latest changes pushed automatically via GitHub
- ✅ **Database Migrated:** All new tables created
- ✅ **Curriculum Populated:** All 15 topics available on live site
- ✅ **Training Button Active:** Accessible from main dashboard

### **Database Commands Run on Live**
```bash
python manage.py migrate                 # ✅ Complete
python manage.py populate_curriculum     # ✅ Complete
```

## 📋 User Experience Flow

### **Current Working Flow:**
1. ✅ Coach clicks "📚 Training" button on dashboard
2. ✅ Training page loads showing student's current ELO (400)
3. ✅ First topic "How the Pawn Moves" displays with full content
4. ✅ Complete teaching instructions, practice activities, and pass criteria shown
5. ✅ Progress marking form available with Pass/Review/Not Ready options

### **Broken Flow (Needs Fix):**
6. ❌ Click "Pass" + "Save Progress" → Nothing happens
7. ❌ Should advance to next topic "How the Rook Moves"
8. ❌ Should increase student ELO by topic points
9. ❌ Should create progress record in database

### **Expected Complete Flow:**
10. 🎯 Student progresses through all 15 topics
11. 🎯 ELO increases from 400 → 600+ as topics are mastered
12. 🎯 Spaced repetition schedules review of older topics
13. 🎯 Coach can track student progress across multiple lessons
